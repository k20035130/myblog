### Archives.org

The museum began in 1996 by archiving the Internet itself, a medium that was just beginning to grow in use. This archive provide free access to researchers, historians, scholars, the print disabled, and the general public. The mission of the archive is to provide Universal Access to All Knowledge. The museum has cooperated relationship with 625+ library. In addition to the objects from other libraries, there are the collections which are uploaded by thousands of partners globally as well. In the Internet Archive, anyone with a free account can upload media to the archive. The archive is for all the visitors around the world, and it has academic contributions since it provides huge amount of information for researchers and scholars. The swipe of this site is not only in the academic field, it also educates all groups, which even starts from pre-school children. As for the conditions of possibilities for this archive, I think they are a group of volunteers. This is a non-profit library of millions of free books, and the financial support of the library comes from donations. So, the staff who work behind the library are paid by the donators.

The collections are organized in books, video, audio, software and images. And each type is divided into two groups: Featured and Top. In the homepage, the collections are displayed as a top list. Each collection is displayed with several metadata, including topics, logos, added date, identifier, scanner, times of views, reviews and the username which people used to upload the images. While as for the collections of books, it presents more details such as Publication date, PublisherDigitizing sponsor, Contributor, Language. Therefore, the introduction to the items is quite detailed. In my opinion, from the aspect of  the source of knowledge, the operation in the Internet Archive is similar with thatâ€™s in Wikipedia. In Wikipedia, users could edit information based on their cognition. If we call Wikipedia is the dictionary edited by community, then this Archive.org is the library contributed by community.
