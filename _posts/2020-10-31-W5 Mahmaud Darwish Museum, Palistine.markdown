### Mahmoud Darwish Museum, Palistine

It is not difficult to tell from the name of the museum that this museum commemorates a well-known author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Darwish">Mahmoud Darwish</a>. As a    a Palestinian poet and author who was regarded as the Palestinian national poet, he won numerous awards for his works. In “About the museum” session, it introduces the mission of museum, which includes collecting Mahmoud Darwish’s intellectual legacy, organizing cultural archives, enlightening youth by spreading Darwish’s message of freedom, and promoting cultural exchange among Westerns and Arabs. The museum is a welcoming destination to all visitors, as well a center for all innovators and amateur talents in Palestine, expecting visitors to know the cultural legacy of Darwish. Additionally, the museum provides an avenue for Palestinians to present artistic creations to the public, encouraging visitors to engage in the process of the contribution to building cultural space in Palestine. According to the introductions of the museum, I think the “conditions of possibilities” for the archives to exist are the group of workers in the cultural institution. The website emphasizes the role of spreading cultural messages and encouraging youth in Palestine to build cultural space taken by the museum. From a macro cultural perspective, presenting the important position of museum for this nation.

The website’s creators use “The poet”, “The Foundation”, “The museum”, “The award”, “Media” and “Contact”, to organize the collections in Mahmoud Darwish Museum. In the session of “Media”, the collections are grouped into photo gallery, audio gallery and video gallery, which are clearly organized. Additionally, 3D video (as showed below) has been applied to present the layout of the museum. It could clearly show the structure of museum though the production is slightly rough. The website also uses three-party platforms to enrich the content of site, such as “Flipping Book” and “GoogleMap”. In the section of “selected poems”, the application uses the sound of flipping books to provide visitors with an immersive experience. And “Google Map” is not displayed in a page, but embedded in the bottom of site. However, I found that there are some limitations of displaying collections in this site. There are insufficient introductions to explain the collections. For example, in the section of photo and gallery, only graphs are displayed. The lack of metadata and explaining texts will reduce visitors’ understanding of collections. Overall, Mahmoud Darwish Museum site clearly claims the place and mission of itself, and organizes the cultural archives and media activities well. However, because of the limited metadata and the fair method of display, it is not quit attractive to me.
